      <p class="norm">Between the time when the goods leave the office of export and/or departure, and the time when they arrive at the office of destination, certain data may have to be entered on the copies of the Single Administrative Document accompanying the goods. These data elements concern the transport operation and are to be entered on the document in the course of the operation by the carrier responsible for the means of transport on which the goods are directly loaded. The data may be added legibly by hand; in this case, the form should be completed in ink in block capitals. These data elements, which only appear on copies 4 and 5, concern the following boxes:</p>

      <p class="norm">Whenever a particular subset contains one or more copies which may be used in a Member State other than the one in which it was first completed, the forms must be completed by typewriter or by a mechanographical or similar process. For ease of completion by typewriter the form should be inserted in the machine in such a way that the first letter of the data to be entered in box 2 is placed in the position box in the top left-hand corner.</p>
      <p class="norm">Where all the copies of a subset are intended for use in the same Member State, they may be filled in legibly by hand, in ink and in block capitals, provided that this is allowed in that Member State. The same applies to the data to be given on the copies used for the purposes of the Union transit procedure.</p>
      <p class="norm">The form must contain no erasures or overwriting. Any alterations must be made by crossing out the incorrect data and adding those required. Any alterations made in this way must be initialled by the person making them and expressly endorsed by the competent authorities. The latter may, where necessary, require a new declaration to be lodged.</p>
      <p class="norm">In addition, the forms may be completed using an automatic reproduction process instead of any of the procedures mentioned above. They may also be produced and completed by this means on condition that the provisions concerning the specimen forms, format, language used, legibility, absence of erasures and overwriting, and amendments are strictly observed.</p>
      <p class="norm">Only numbered boxes are to be completed, as appropriate, by operators. The other boxes, identified by a capital letter, are for administrative use.</p>

Column 1 gives the chapter number, 4-digit heading or 6-digit sub-heading number used in the Harmonized System, as appropriate. Column 2 gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in columns 1 and 2, subject to Note 2.4, one or more rules (‘qualifying operations’) are set out in column 3. These qualifying operations concern only non-originating materials. Where, in some cases, the entry in column 1 is preceded by ‘ex’, this signifies that the rule in column 3 applies only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.</p>

In these cases, column 3 is split into two subcolumns, (a) and (b), with subcolumn (a) showing the rule applicable to LDC beneficiary countries and subcolumn (b) showing the rule applicable to all other beneficiary countries as well as to exports from the European Union to a beneficiary country for the purposes of bilateral cumulation.</p>

      <p class="list">However, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.</p>
